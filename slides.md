## Getting started with Expo
----

## Why use Expo?

* Default way to get started without any know-how
* Live-Reload
* Fast testing on any device
  * Also for non-devs!
* Playground for snippets (snack.expo.io)
* **OTA** updates!
----

## When don't use Expo?

* Custom native code or modules required
* Small app size matters
---

## Wrapping up
----

## Pros

* Getting started without any native skills is easy
* Develop once, run everywhere
* Whole power of npm modules can be used
* Huge community (but not that huge like for React)
---

## Cons

* It's alyways better to know how the native modules work
* UX- and navigation patterns differ from web
* Not usable for game development
* Not all implementations perform the same on Android & iOS
---

## Develop once, run **REALLY** everywhere
